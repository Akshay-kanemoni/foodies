     <H2>TELANAGANA THALI</H2>
     <p>Telanganaites are a hardy lot, unfazed by the predominantly hot climate and semi-arid conditions of their state. The food of the region, too, reflects this robust character. Most dishes are rustic, with the traditional meal consisting of flat breads, curry dishes, savouries and accompaniments as well as pickles.
      <a href=" https://www.myspicykitchen.net/simple-telugu-bhojanam-telugu-thali-from-telangana/">  <p style="text-align: center;font-size: medium;"> <img src="./images/TELANGANA THALI ....jpg" style="border-radius: 25px;width: 100%;"></p></a></p>
     <P>The traditional breads are made of millet or sorghum although wheat chapatti is also eaten in regular meals. Curry dishes incorporate bold flavours such as chilli, tamarind, sesame seeds and coconut. Many dishes are non-vegetarian, with chicken and mutton being the preferred proteins. The eternal favourites – idli, dosa and vada – are also relished across the board.
        Of course, state capital Hyderabad has its own distinctive cuisine. The Qutub Shahi and Nizami influence of about 400 years gave Indian gastronomy a much-celebrated chapter that includes biryani, haleem, dalcha, murg ka kurma, qubani ka meetha and many other delicacies. Much of the cuisine was developed in the royal kitchens. Slow cooking, that has been influenced by the Dum Pukht method used in Awadhi cuisine, is the hallmark of Hyderabadi cuisine.</P>


        <H2>ANDHRA THALI</H2>
        <P>Andhra Pradesh is a state bordering India’s south eastern coast. The state is composed of two regions , coastal Andhra and Rayalaseema.
 
            Since the state has a long coastline, the cuisine has lot of sea food, though there are many vegetarians too. The food is spicy and the use of spices is rather lavish. One can notice a lot of variety where chutneys and pickles are concerned.People here are Ricę eaters, no wonder the state is called ‘ rice bowl of India’.
            <a href="https://www.chitrasfoodbook.com/2012/07/andhra-thali-andhra-lunch.html"><p style="text-align: center;font-size: medium;"> <img src="./images/ANDRA THALI....jpg " style="border-radius: 25px;width: 100%;"></p> </a></P>
            <P>We are familiar with the Hyderabadi cuisine, it is one of the finest Royal cuisines of the world. The Hyderabadi Biryani, Mirch ka Saalan are the most popular dishes of this state.One can also find traces of Mughal cuisine in Andhra cuisine. The super delicious Kebabs,Keemas, Biryanis, are some popular dishes from Hyderabad.
                Here is my attempt to create a Thali for this state. I might not be perfect but I am sure you will relish it. The meal is normally served on a plantain leaf and each dish has its own placement .

         <H2>PUNJABI THALI</H2>
         <P>Punjabi Cuisine is one of the most distinct and popular Indian cuisines and comes from the region of Punjab situated partially in India and Pakistan. It offers a vast variety of delectable and exotic vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes that are prepared with varied traditional culinary styles, particularly the tandoori style. The exotic and appetizing tandoor items and various other mouth-watering and finger licking dishes having rich, spicy and buttery flavour savoured with Punjabi Basmati rice of varied forms and special Punjabi breads like Tandoori Roti and Naan have not only made the gastronomists crave for more but has also garnered the cuisine much fame outside the Punjab region taking it to places around the globe like Canada and the UK.
           <a href="https://cookwithrenu.com/vegetarian-punjabi-thali/"><p style="text-align: center;font-size: medium;"> <img src="./images/PUNJABI THALI....jpg " style="border-radius: 25px;width: 100%;"></p></a> </P>
            <P>Punjab with its rich cultivating lands has traditionally been an agrarian society since the time of the ancient Harappan Civilization. The land in the Indian Punjab is ideal for growing wheat and is called the ‘Granary of India’ or ‘India's bread-basket’. The two major crops cultivated by the farmers of Punjab are rice and wheat, which remain the principal crops grown during the Kharif season and the Rabi season respectively. The indigenous Punjab Basmati rice has been the pride of the region being grown since time immemorial. The practice of multi-cropping is quite common in Punjab which also grows sugarcane, bajra (pearl millet), jowar (great millet), barley, potatoes, vegetables and fruits among others. Cattle primarily used for agriculture and dairy farming in the region form the major source of dairy products starting from ghee, butter, clarified butter, curd, paneer (cottage cheese) to a wide variety of sweet dishes. Thus the staple foods grown locally including the dairy products form an integral part of the local diet</P>

            <H2>RAJASTHANI THALI</H2>
            <P>The cuisine that originated in Rajasthan and the surrounding region in India is known as the Rajasthani cuisine. The state of Rajasthan is famed for its rich regal culture and heritage. The arid nature of the region, the extreme climatic conditions, scarcity of water and vegetation has witnessed evolvement of unique cooking styles and food habits of the natives that is noticeably different from other Indian cuisines. The Rajasthanis have moulded their culinary styles in such a way that many of their dishes can be shelved for several days and served without heating. The royal heritage of the region as well as the gastronomic enthusiasm among locals have led to a wide variety of delectable and exquisite Rajasthani dishes starting from main courses to snacks to sweet dishes. Some items like Dal-Baati-Churma and Bikaneri Bhujia have garnered both national and international popularity among foodies.
               <a href="http://ribbonstopastas.com/recipe/rajasthani-thali/"><p style="text-align: center;font-size: medium;"> <img src="./images/RAJASTHANI THALI.jpg " style="border-radius: 25px;width: 100%;"></p></a> </P>
                <P>The culinary style of the region to a great extent shaped up according to the bellicose lifestyle of the natives. Unavailability of a variety of fresh vegetables, fruits and other ingredients and scarcity of water due to the arid nature of the region has profound effect on the cooking style of the locals, particularly those living in the desert pockets. Traditionally the locals preferred to prepare such items that could be retained for a few days and consumed without heating them. Paucity of water in the region has witnessed extensive use of dairy products by the inhabitants like milk, butter and butter milk so as to compensate or reduce the water content while cooking. Beans, dried lentils and legumes like gram flour, bajra and jowar form the main ingredients of many of the Rajasthani dishes. Ghee is liberally used in preparing different Rajasthani dishes which are rich in spice and flavour. Although predominantly a vegetarian region, the influence of the Rajputs who savoured non-vegetarian dishes including game meat saw the evolution of several luscious non-vegetarian dishes such as laal maas, jungle maas, khad khargosh and safed maas.

        <H2>BENGALI THALI</H2>
        <P>Bengali food that originated and evolved in the region of Bengal situated in the eastern subcontinent of India (presently divided into West Bengal in India and a separate nation called Bangladesh) is rich and varied in its platter starting from snacks to main courses to sweets. Although the food habits, tastes, preferences and choice of items vary with different districts, communities and religions, the basic course generally remains the same with rice and fish playing a dominant role. Probably this is why a Bengali is often typified as a ‘Maache-Bhaate-Bangali’ where Maach means fish and Bhaat means boiled rice in Bengali. A Bengali meal follows a multi-course tradition where food is served course-wise usually in a specific format, marking it as the only meal of the subcontinent to have evolved such convention.

        <H2>GUJARATHI THALI</H2>
        <P>Gujarati food originated from Gujarat, the western coastline state of India, often referred to as "Jewel of Western India". Although the long coastline ensures huge variety of seafood, the influence of Jain culture and philosophy makes the region a predominantly vegetarian barring some communities who incorporate non-vegetarian items such as goat, chicken, eggs and seafood in their platter.

Coconuts grow in abundance in Kerala, so grated coconut and coconut milk are commonly used for thickening and flavouring.[4] Kerala's long coastline and numerous rivers have led to a strong fishing industry in the region, making seafood a common part of meals. Rice is grown in abundance along with tapioca. It is the main starch ingredient used in Kerala's foodHaving been a major production area of spices for thousands of years, the region makes frequent use of black pepper, cardamom, clove, ginger, and cinnamon.
